          III.Requirements:

          1.Working with other teams:

              You may discuss your project and the technologies you are using with other teams but each team
              must build its own application and submit its own work.

          2.Working with members of your team In general:

              each student in a group will receive the same grade. If you run into issues with your teammates,
              it is your responsibility to attempt to resolve them. If you are unable to work with a member of
              your team (for example, if they disappear and fail to respond to attempts to contact them), bring
              the problem to my attention as soon as possible do not wait until the due date.

          3.Presentations:

              On presentation day, you will have 15 minutes to give a short demonstration of your application
              to the class. Include both functionality and implementation details. Your entire team must be
              present and available to answer questions, but individual team members may volunteer to deliver
              the presentation.

          4.Grading:

              Each of the following factors contributes up to 3 points to the final grade for the project,
              for a total of 30
              points:

              1. Quality of the presentation
              2. Quality of documentation for installing and configuring the application
              3. Quality of documentation for users trying out the application
              4. Project functionality
              5. Project scope
              6. Code quality
              7. Appropriate use of available technologies.

              10. Teamwork

          5.Submission:

              submission, print the next two sheets, fill out the spaces on the first sheet,and submit both sheets to
              the professor in class by presentation day. Failure to follow the instructions exactly will incur a 10%
